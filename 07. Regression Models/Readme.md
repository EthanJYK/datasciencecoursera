## Regression Models Course Project:  Effect of Transmission Types on Fuel Efficiency

#### Goals:
> "You work for _Motor Trend,_ a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:  Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG? Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions."

-   Write as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
-   Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
-   Include a first paragraph executive summary.

#### Summary:
This study examines the effect of transmission type on fuel efficiency of cars using 1974 Motor Trend US magazine data. Based on its model choice creteria, this study takes horsepower as a co-determinant of miles per gallon(mpg) while maintaining auto/manual transmission type as the main independent variable. After taking natural logs on the values of mpg and horsepower to reshape their correlation more linear, the model shows that manual transmission has some positive effect in fuel efficiency while horsepower keeps a strong negative correlation with mpg.
